<h2>DESCRIPTON OF THE TASK</h2>

This code is a simple arithmetic expression parser and evaluator implemented in C++.

It can handle basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation),

as well as some advanced functions like trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan, asin, acos, atan), square root (sqrt), factorial (!), and constants like 'pi'.

It also supports parentheses for grouping expressions and handles degrees for trigonometric functions.

<h2>Key Components of the Code</h2>

1. Tokenization (Lexer):

The Lexer class breaks the input string into tokens, which are the smallest meaningful units of the expression (e.g., numbers, operators, functions, parentheses).

It identifies tokens like +, -, *, /, ^, sin, cos, pi, etc., and assigns them a TokenType.

2. Parsing and Evaluation (Parser):

The Parser class processes the tokens generated by the Lexer and evaluates the expression according to the rules of arithmetic precedence and associativity.

It uses recursive descent parsing to handle nested expressions and operator precedence.

3. Supported Operations:

Basic Arithmetic: +, -, *, /, ^ (exponentiation), % (percentage).

Functions: sin, cos, tan, asin, acos, atan, sqrt.

Constants: pi.

Factorial: !.

Parentheses: ( and ) for grouping expressions.

Degrees: deg to specify that trigonometric inputs are in degrees.

4. Error Handling:

The code includes error handling for invalid inputs, such as division by zero, invalid characters, or mismatched parentheses.

<h2>Key Points to Note:</h2>

1. Input:

The user enters an arithmetic expression (e.g., 2 + 3 * sin(45 deg).

The program reads the input as a string.

2. Tokenization:

The Lexer scans the input string and converts it into a sequence of tokens. For example:

    Input: 2 + 3 * sin(45 deg)

Tokens: NUMBER(2), ADD, NUMBER(3), MUL, SIN, LPAREN, NUMBER(45), DEG, RPAREN.

3. Parsing:

The Parser processes the tokens and evaluates the expression step by step:

It follows the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS):

    Parentheses

    Exponentiation

    Multiplication and Division

    Addition and Subtraction

It handles functions and constants by evaluating their values.

4. Evaluation:

The parser computes the result of the expression. For example:

    2 + 3 * sin(45 deg) becomes 2 + 3 * 0.7071 (since sin(45 deg) â‰ˆ 0.7071).

The final result is computed as

    2 + 2.1213 = 4.1213.

Output:

The program prints the result of the evaluated expression.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

This program is a simple yet powerful arithmetic expression evaluator.

It can handle a wide range of mathematical operations and functions, making it suitable for basic to moderately complex calculations.

The use of recursive descent parsing ensures that expressions are evaluated correctly according to mathematical rules.

The program is interactive, allowing users to input expressions and see the results immediately.
